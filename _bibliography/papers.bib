  abstract = "Non-invasive diagnostic modalities are integral to cardiovascular care; however, current systems primarily measure peripheral pressure, limiting the breadth of cardiovascular prognostication. We report a novel approach for extracting left side heart sounds using a brachial cuff device. The technique leverages brachial cuff device enhanced signal resolution to capture pressure fluctuations generated by cardiohemic system vibrations, the sound pressure waveform. We analyze left heart catheterization data alongside simultaneous brachial cuff device measurements to correlate sound pressure waveform features with left ventricle (LV) contractility. The extracted sound pressure waveform reveals two prominent oscillatory wave packets, termed WP1 and WP2, originating from cardiac structure vibrations associated with LV contractions and relaxation. We demonstrate that WP1 originates from LV contraction during systolic blood ejection through the aortic valve (AV) and is correlated with LV isovolumetric contraction, clinically measured by LV dPdt-max (Pearson-R = 0.65, p < 0.001). Additionally, we show that WP2 comes from LV elongation required for blood flow deceleration at the end of systole, causing AV closure, and is correlated with LV isovolumetric relaxation, measured by LV ndPdt-max (Pearson-R = 0.55, p < 0.001). These findings highlight the value of cuff sound pressure waveforms in providing insights about dynamic coupling of the LV-Aorta complex for non-invasive assessment of LV contractility.",

  abstract  = "Radial applanation tonometry is a well-established technique forhemodynamic monitoring and is becoming popular in affordablenon-invasive wearable healthcare electronics. To assess thecentral aortic pressure using radial-based measurements, thereis an essential need to develop mathematical approaches toestimate the central pressure waveform. In this study, wepropose a new Fourier-based machine learning (F-ML) methodologyto transfer non-invasive radial pressure measurements to thecentral pressure waveform. To test the method, collection oftonometry recordings of the radial and carotid pressuremeasurements are used from the Framingham Heart Study (2640individuals, 55 \% women) with mean (range) age of 66 (40-91)years. Method-derived estimates are significantly correlatedwith the measured ones for three major features of the pressurewaveform (systolic blood pressure, r=0.97, p < 0.001; diastolicblood pressure, r=0.99, p < 0.001; and mean blood pressure,r=0.99, p < 0.001). In all cases, the Bland-Altman analysisshows negligible bias in the estimations and error is bounded to5.4 mmHg. Findings also suggest that the F-ML approachreconstructs the shape of the central pressure waveformaccurately with the average normalized root mean square error of5.5 \% in the testing population which is blinded to all stagesof machine learning development. The results show that the F-MLtransfer function outperforms the conventional generalizedtransfer function, particularly in terms of reconstructing theshape of the central pressure waveform morphology. The proposedF-ML transfer function can provide accurate estimates for thecentral pressure waveform, and ultimately expand the usage ofnon-invasive devices for central hemodynamic assessment.",

  abstract  = "Cuff-based pulse waveform acquisition (CBPWA) devices arereliable solutions for non-invasive cardiovascular diagnostics.However, poor signal resolution has limited clinicalapplications. This study aims to demonstrate the improved signalquality of CBPWA devices by implementing passive pneumaticlow-pass filters (pLPF). Conventionally, pressure sensor outputresolution is a percentage of the operating range. Therefore,measurement of small pressure changes in a large range mustsacrifice signal resolution to accommodate for the large meanpressures. We design a pLPF to obtain the running mean pressureand combine it with a high-resolution differential pressuresensor for isolating the signal's pulsatile component.Thirty-one volunteers participated in a device proof-of-conceptstudy at Caltech. Volunteers were measured at rest in the supineposition on the left arm. The filtering behavior ismathematically modeled and experimentally verified, showing goodagreement between measured and predicted cutoff frequencies. Inthe human study, the device successfully captured high-fidelitypulse waveform measurements for all volunteers: a blood pressure(BP) reading was followed by inflate-and-hold acquisition indiastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and suprasystolic BP (sSBP). The study demonstrated the reliability andhigh signal resolution of pLPF for CBPWA. Considering thewidespread use of the brachial cuff, a system forhigh-resolution CBPWA motivates the clinical implementation ofnon-invasive pulse waveform analysis (PWA).",

  author    = "Tamborini, Alessio and Gharib, Morteza",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Noninvasive pulse waveform analysis is valuable forcentral cardiovascular assessment, yet controversies persistover its validity in peripheral measurements. Our objective wasto compare waveform features from a cuff system withsuprasystolic blood pressure hold with an invasive aorticmeasurement. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study analyzed data from88 subjects undergoing concurrent aortic catheterization andbrachial pulse waveform acquisition using a suprasystolic bloodpressure cuff system. Oscillometric blood pressure (BP) wascompared with invasive aortic systolic BP and diastolic BP.Association between cuff and catheter waveform features wasperformed on a set of 15 parameters inclusive of magnitudes,time intervals, pressure-time integrals, and slopes of thepulsations. The evaluation covered both static (subject-averagedvalues) and dynamic (breathing-induced fluctuations) behaviors.Peripheral BP values from the cuff device were higher thancatheter values (systolic BP-residual, 6.5 mm Hg; diastolicBP-residual, 12.4 mm Hg). Physiological correction for pressureamplification in the arterial system improved systolic BPprediction (r2=0.83). Dynamic calibration generated noninvasiveBP fluctuations that reflect those invasively measured (systolicBP Pearson R=0.73, P0.5, P<0.001), encompassing magnitudes,timings, and pressure-time integrals but not slope-basedparameters. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the deviceand methods for peripheral waveform measurements presented herecan be used for noninvasive estimation of central BP and asubset of aortic waveform features. These results serve as abenchmark for central cardiovascular assessment usingsuprasystolic BP cuff-based devices and contribute to preservingsystem dynamics in noninvasive measurements.",

  abstract = {Cell migration, critical to numerous biological processes, can be guided by surface topography. Studying the effects of topography on cell migration is valuable for enhancing our understanding of directional cell migration and for functionally engineering cell behavior. However, fabrication limitations constrain topography studies to geometries that may not adequately mimic physiological environments. Direct Laser Writing (DLW) provides the necessary 3D flexibility and control to create well-defined waveforms with curvature and length scales that are similar to those found in physiological settings, such as the luminal walls of blood vessels that endothelial cells migrate along. We find that endothelial cells migrate fastest along square waves, intermediate along triangular waves, and slowest along sine waves and that directional cell migration on sine waves decreases as sinusoid wavelength increases. Interestingly, inhibition of Rac1 decreases directional migration on sine wave topographies but not on flat surfaces with micropatterned lines, suggesting that cells may utilize different molecular pathways to sense curved topographies. Our study demonstrates that DLW can be employed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of topography on cell migration by fabricating a wide array of physiologically-relevant surfaces with curvatures that are challenging to fabricate using conventional manufacturing techniques.},
