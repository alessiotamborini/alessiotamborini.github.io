  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {Cell migration, critical to numerous biological processes, can be guided by surface topography. Studying the effects of topography on cell migration is valuable for enhancing our understanding of directional cell migration and for functionally engineering cell behavior. However, fabrication limitations constrain topography studies to geometries that may not adequately mimic physiological environments. Direct Laser Writing (DLW) provides the necessary 3D flexibility and control to create well-defined waveforms with curvature and length scales that are similar to those found in physiological settings, such as the luminal walls of blood vessels that endothelial cells migrate along. We find that endothelial cells migrate fastest along square waves, intermediate along triangular waves, and slowest along sine waves and that directional cell migration on sine waves decreases as sinusoid wavelength increases. Interestingly, inhibition of Rac1 decreases directional migration on sine wave topographies but not on flat surfaces with micropatterned lines, suggesting that cells may utilize different molecular pathways to sense curved topographies. Our study demonstrates that DLW can be employed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of topography on cell migration by fabricating a wide array of physiologically-relevant surfaces with curvatures that are challenging to fabricate using conventional manufacturing techniques.},

  title     = "A new methodology for determining the central pressure waveform
               from peripheral measurement using Fourier-based machine learning",
  author    = "Aghilinejad, Arian and Tamborini, Alessio and Gharib, Morteza",
  abstract  = "Radial applanation tonometry is a well-established technique for
               hemodynamic monitoring and is becoming popular in affordable
               non-invasive wearable healthcare electronics. To assess the
               central aortic pressure using radial-based measurements, there
               is an essential need to develop mathematical approaches to
               estimate the central pressure waveform. In this study, we
               propose a new Fourier-based machine learning (F-ML) methodology
               to transfer non-invasive radial pressure measurements to the
               central pressure waveform. To test the method, collection of
               tonometry recordings of the radial and carotid pressure
               measurements are used from the Framingham Heart Study (2640
               individuals, 55 \% women) with mean (range) age of 66 (40-91)
               years. Method-derived estimates are significantly correlated
               with the measured ones for three major features of the pressure
               waveform (systolic blood pressure, r=0.97, p < 0.001; diastolic
               blood pressure, r=0.99, p < 0.001; and mean blood pressure,
               r=0.99, p < 0.001). In all cases, the Bland-Altman analysis
               shows negligible bias in the estimations and error is bounded to
               5.4 mmHg. Findings also suggest that the F-ML approach
               reconstructs the shape of the central pressure waveform
               accurately with the average normalized root mean square error of
               5.5 \% in the testing population which is blinded to all stages
               of machine learning development. The results show that the F-ML
               transfer function outperforms the conventional generalized
               transfer function, particularly in terms of reconstructing the
               shape of the central pressure waveform morphology. The proposed
               F-ML transfer function can provide accurate estimates for the
               central pressure waveform, and ultimately expand the usage of
               non-invasive devices for central hemodynamic assessment.",
