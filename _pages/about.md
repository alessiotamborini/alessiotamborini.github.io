I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Medical Engineering at Caltech, working in the [Gharib Research Group](https://www.gharib.caltech.edu/). My research focuses on the development of non-invasive diagnostic medical technologies, with a primary emphasis on applications in cardiology and ophthalmology. My work spans the entire innovation process, from conceptualizing and prototyping devices to performing advanced data analysis and leveraging machine learning techniques to extract clinically significant insights.

During my Ph.D., I led the development of a novel blood pressure cuff system specifically designed to enhance heart health diagnostics by leveraging pulse waveform analysis. The unique, patient-specific characteristics of blood pressure waveforms provide non-invasive and actionable insights into cardiovascular health, offering a comprehensive analysis of an individual's heart functions.
